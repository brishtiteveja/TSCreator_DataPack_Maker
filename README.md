	* Java: Java 1.6 or later.
	* Browser: as of 2.1.2, the optimizer can run in a web browser that has array extras. While the optimizer options are the same as shown below, it is called via JavaScript instead of command line options. It is also only good for generating optimized single files, not a directory optimization. See the browser example. This option is really only useful for providing web-based custom builds of your library.
